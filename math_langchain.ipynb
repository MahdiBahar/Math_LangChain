The logarithmic function is used here to scale down the potentially large numbers and ensure that the score grows more slowly as years in the bank increase.\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\log((\\\\text{years\\\\_in\\\\_bank})^3) \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 4: Divide by Age\\n\\nFinally, divide the result from step 3 by the customer's age. This division adjusts for the fact that older customers naturally have had more time to accumulate banking years and ensures that younger customers with longer relationships are not unduly penalized.\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{score} = \\\\frac{\\\\log((\\\\text{years\\\\_in\\\\_bank})^3)}{\\\\text{age}} \\\\]\\n\\n### Step 5: Interpret the Result\\n\\nThe resulting score is a metric reflecting both loyalty (as indicated by years in the bank) and age. A higher score suggests a strong relationship with the bank relative to the customer's age.\\n\\n### Example Calculation:\\n\\nLet's assume a customer has been with the bank for 10 years and is 40 years old.\\n\\n1. **Years in Bank**: 10\\n2. **Age**: 40\\n\\n- Calculate \\\\((\\\\text{years\\\\_in\\\\_bank})^3 = 10^3 = 1000\\\\)\\n- Take the logarithm: \\\\(\\\\log(1000) \\\\approx 6.9078\\\\) (using natural log)\\n- Divide by age: \\\\(\\\\frac{6.9078}{40} \\\\approx 0.1727\\\\)\\n\\nThe customer's score would be approximately \\\\(0.1727\\\\).\\n\\nThis step-by-step process allows you to consistently calculate the score for any given customer using their years in the bank and their age.\"}\n"

For example, if it's 6 months, the calculation would be:\\n\\n1. \\\\( 500,000,000 \\\\times 6 = 3,000,000,000 \\\\)\\n2. \\\\( \\\\frac{3,000,000,000}{12} = 250,000,000 \\\\)\\n3. \\\\( 250,000,000 \\\\times 0.25 = 62,500,000 \\\\)\\n\\nSo, for 6 months, the interest would be 62.5 million.
